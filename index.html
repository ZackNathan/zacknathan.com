                    <p>
                        Thank you for visiting zacknathan.com.
                        I am Zack Nathan, a 17 year old student living in Toronto.
                        I am graduating from Upper Canada College in May, and I am part of the class of 2022 at Dartmouth College where I plan on studying computer science.
                        Since 2008, I've spent my summers at Camp Manitou, where I now work as a counsellor.
                        <!-- I am involved in several student clubs at UCC, including reach for the top (trivia) and model United Nations. -->
                        <br> <br>
                        I love snowboarding, and I play the guitar.
                        I am a passionate fan of the Maple Leafs, Blue Jays, and Raptors (I watch a lot of sports).
                        I have a pet dog named Coco who I love very much.
                        My favourite TV shows are Black Mirror and The Office.
                        My favourite video games are Rocket League and Europa Universalis.
                        My favourite movies are Paul Blart Mall Cop 2, The Emoji Movie, and Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace.

                        As you can probably tell, by the fact that I've created a personal website, I have a passion for programming and technology.
                        This page of my website will function as a resume and as a portfolio, with links to some of my other work.
