                        Study buddy is an app for helping students manage their assignments, exams, and other school work.
                        Rather than having to check different calendars and pages for each class, this app will allow students to easily track all of their work in one convenient place, reducing stress.
                        Users can add details about their assignments, including the class, due date and time, type (paper, lab, exam, problem set, etc.), and amount of time needed to complete it.
                        The app will also include an automatic priority index, using the data entered by the user to calculate priority values for each assignment.
                        The user can then sort and filter assignments by priority, due date and time, class, type, and amount of time needed.
                        Customized due date notifications can be set up for high priority assignments, specific types (such as exams), and any other assignments the user chooses.
                        After an assignment has been completed, the user can satisfyingly swipe it away, checking an item of their to-do list.
